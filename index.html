Letâ€™s be honest, weâ€™re both mentally cooked. Burnt out. Fried. Fuckrd up. Spiraling on a loop. But somehow, despite all that, we still have each other. And honestly? Thatâ€™s kind of beautiful (and a little unhinged). Thank you for being my go-to person when Iâ€™m overthinking, crying, or just staring at the ceiling wondering what the hell is going on with life. Thank you for staying, even when I make zero sense, even when I disappear sometimes, even when I act like Iâ€™m okay when Iâ€™m very much not. Youâ€™re the one person I can be completely weird with â€” like ugly laugh, ugly cry, full mental breakdown at 1am weird â€” and never feel judged. I love that about us. No matter how messy life gets, no matter how many mental resets we need in a week, we always somehow end up sending each other TikToks or trauma-dumping at random times of day. I donâ€™t always say this, but Iâ€™m really glad I have you. If I ever start acting like I donâ€™t care, just know I do. Always. In my own non-clingy, sarcastic, emotionally constipated way. Love you, freak.
